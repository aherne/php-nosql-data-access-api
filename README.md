## About 

This API is a ultra light weight [Data Access Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_layer) that acts like an equivalent of [PDO](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) for NoSQL [key-value databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-value_database) (aka key-value stores). As a data access layer, its purpose is to to shield complexity of working with different NoSQL vendors and provide a simple as well as elegant interface for connecting and querying. At this time, following vendors are supported:

- **APC**: an extremely fast database without persistence abilities, handled directly by PHP that uses opcode cache and data store
- **APCu**: an extremely fast database without persistence abilities, handled directly by PHP that uses only data store
- **Memcache**: a very fast database with persistence abilities, requiring you to have MemCache server installed on your machine
- **Memcached**: a very fast database with persistence abilities, requiring you to have MemCache server installed on your machine
- **Redis**: a slightly slower database with persistence abilities and many extra features, requiring you to have Redis server installed on your machine
- **Couchbase**: a slower database with persistence abilities and many extra features, requiring you to have Couchbase server installed on your machine

The whole idea of working with NoSQL databases (vendors) is reduced to following steps:

- **[configuration](#configuration)**: setting up an XML file where NoSQL vendors used by your site are configured per development environment
- **[execution](#execution)**: using [Lucinda\NoSQL\Wrapper](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/Wrapper.php) to read above XML based on development environment, compile [Lucinda\NoSQL\DataSource](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/DataSource.php) object(s) storing connection information and inject them statically into
[Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionSingleton](#class-connectionsingleton) or [Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionFactory](#class-connectionfactory) classes

API is fully PSR-4 compliant, only requiring PHP8.1+ interpreter, SimpleXML extension and official extension for each vendor. To quickly see how it works, check:

- **[installation](#installation)**: describes how to install API on your computer, in light of steps above
- **[unit tests](#unit-tests)**: API has 100% Unit Test coverage, using [UnitTest API](https://github.com/aherne/unit-testing) instead of PHPUnit for greater flexibility
- **[examples](#examples)**: shows a deep example of API functionality

## Configuration

To configure this API you must have a XML with a **nosql** tag inside:

```xml
<nosql>
	<{ENVIRONMENT}>
		<server name="..." driver="..." {OPTIONS}/>
		...
	</{ENVIRONMENT}>
	...
</nosql>
```

Where:

- **nosql**: holds global connection information for NoSQL vendors used
    - {ENVIRONMENT}: name of development environment (to be replaced with "local", "dev", "live", etc)
        - **server**: stores connection information about a single vendor via attributes:
            - *name*: (optional) unique identifier. Required if multiple nosql vendors are used for same environment!
            - *driver*: (mandatory) NoSQL vendor name. Supported values: apc, apcu, memcache, memcached, redis, couchbase
            - {OPTIONS}: a list of extra attributes necessary to configure respective vendor identified by *driver* above:
                - *host*: server host name (eg: 127.0.0.1), host name and port (eg: 127.0.0.1:1234) or list of host names and ports separated by commas (eg: 192.168.1.9:1234,192.168.1.10:4567). Required unless *driver* is APC/APCu!
                - *timeout*: (not recommended) time in seconds by which idle connection is automatically closed. Not supported if *driver* is APC/APCu/Couchbase!
                - *persistent*: (not recommended) whether or not connections should be persisted across sections (value can be: 0 or 1). Not supported if *driver* is APC/APCu/Couchbase!
                - *username*: user name to use in connection. Required if *driver* is Couchbase, ignored otherwise!
                - *password*: password to use in connection. Required if *driver* is Couchbase, ignored otherwise!
                - *bucket_name*: name of bucket (equivalent of SQL schema) where key-value pairs are stored. Required if *driver* is Couchbase, ignored otherwise!
                - *bucket_password*: (optional) bucket password. Optional if *driver* is Couchbase, ignored otherwise!

Example:

```xml
<nosql>
    <local>
        <server driver="memcached" host="127.0.0.1"/>
    </local>
    <live>
        <server driver="redis" host="127.0.0.1"/>
    </live>
</nosql>
```

## Execution

Once you have completed step above, you need to run this in order to be able to connect and query database(s) later on:

```php
new Lucinda\NoSQL\Wrapper(simplexml_load_file(XML_FILE_NAME), DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT);
```

This will wrap each **server** tag found for current development environment into [Lucinda\NoSQL\DataSource](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/DataSource.php) objects and inject them statically into:

- [Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionSingleton](#class-connectionsingleton): if your application uses a single NoSQL vendors per environment (the usual case)
- [Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionFactory](#class-connectionfactory): if your application uses multiple NoSQL vendors per environment (in which case **server** tags must have *name* attribute)

Both classes above insure a single [Lucinda\NoSQL\Driver](#interface-driver) is reused per server throughout session (input-output request flow) duration when . If vendor associated is not embedded (APC/APCu) and requires a server, same object also implements [Lucinda\NoSQL\Server](#interface-server), which can be used in connection management.

There may be situations when abstraction provided by [Lucinda\NoSQL\Driver](#interface-driver) is not enough and you need to run *specific* operations known only to respective vendor. You can do so by extra **getDriver** method, available unless vendor is APC/APCu:

| Method | Arguments | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| getDriver | void | [Redis](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis#class-redis) | Gets access to redis native driver if data source is redis. |
| getDriver | void | [Memcache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.memcache.php) | Gets access to memcache native driver if data source is memcache. |
| getDriver | void | [Memcached](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php) | Gets access to memcached native driver if data source is memcached. |
| getDriver | void | [CouchbaseBucket](https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-php-client-2.0.1/classes/CouchbaseBucket.html) | Gets access to couchbase native driver if data source is couchbase. |

## Installation

First choose a folder where API will be installed then write this command there using console:

```console
composer require lucinda/nosql-data-access
```

Then create a *configuration.xml* file holding configuration settings (see [configuration](#configuration) above) and a *index.php* file (see [initialization](#initialization) above) in project root with following code:

```php
require(__DIR__."/vendor/autoload.php");
new Lucinda\NoSQL\Wrapper(simplexml_load_file("configuration.xml"), "local");
```

Then you are able to query server, as in below example:

```php
$driver = Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionSingleton::getInstance();
$driver->set("hello", "world");
```

## Examples

### Working With Shared Driver

Usage example:

```php
$driver = Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionSingleton::getInstance();
$driver->set("i", 1, 10); // sets key i as 1 for 10 seconds
$driver->get("i"); // returns 1
$driver->contains("i"); // returns true
$driver->increment("i"); // returns 2
$driver->decrement("i"); // returns 1
$driver->delete("i"); // deletes key i from store
$driver->flush(); // clears all value in store
```

### Working With Native Driver

Usage example (assumes driver was redis):

```php
$driver = Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionSingleton::getInstance();
$redisDriver = $driver->getDriver();
if ($redisDriver->ping()) {
    echo "Success!";
}
```

## Reference Guide

### Class ConnectionSingleton

[Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionSingleton](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/ConnectionSingleton.php) class insures a single [Lucinda\NoSQL\Driver](#interface-driver) is used per session. Has following public static methods:

| Method | Arguments | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| static setDataSource | [Lucinda\NoSQL\DataSource](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/DataSource.php) | void | Sets data source detected beforehand. Done automatically by API! |
| static getInstance | void | [Lucinda\NoSQL\Driver](#interface-driver) | Gets driver from data source, opens connection in case object implements [Lucinda\NoSQL\Server](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/Server.php) and returns it for later querying. Throws [Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionException](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/ConnectionException.php) if connection fails! |

Usage example:

```php
$driver = Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionSingleton::getInstance();
$driver->set("hello", "world"); // sets in store a "hello" key whose value is "world"
```

### Class ConnectionFactory

[Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionFactory](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/ConnectionFactory.php) class insures a single [Lucinda\NoSQL\Driver](#interface-driver) is used per session and server name. Has following public static methods:

| Method | Arguments | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| static setDataSource | string $serverName, [Lucinda\NoSQL\DataSource](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/DataSource.php) | void | Sets data source detected beforehand per value of *name* attribute @ **server** tag. Done automatically by API! |
| static getInstance | string $serverName | [Lucinda\NoSQL\Driver](#interface-driver) | Gets driver from data source based on value of *name* attribute @ **server** tag, opens connection in case object implements [Lucinda\NoSQL\Server](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/Server.php) and returns it for later querying.  Throws [Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionException](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/ConnectionException.php) if connection fails! |

Usage example:

```php
$driver = Lucinda\NoSQL\ConnectionFactory::getInstance("myServer");
$driver->get("hello"); // gets value of "hello" key from store
```
### Interface Server

[Lucinda\NoSQL\Server](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/Server.php) interface defines operations to manage connection to key-value store servers via following methods:

| Method | Arguments | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| connect | [Lucinda\NoSQL\DataSource](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/DataSource.php) | void | Connects to database server based on matching vendor's data source. Throws [Lucinda\SQL\ConnectionException](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/ConnectionException.php) if connection fails! |
| disconnect | void | void | Closes connection to database server. |

Above methods HANDLED BY API AUTOMATICALLY, so **to be used only in niche situations**!

### Interface Driver

[Lucinda\NoSQL\Driver](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/Driver.php) interface defines operations to perform on key-value stores via following methods:

| Method | Arguments | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| set | string $key, $value, int $expiration=0 | void | Sets value in store by key, available for seconds defined by expiration (unless later is zero). |
| get | string $key | mixed | Gets value from store by key. |
| contains | string $key | bool | Checks if key exists in store. |
| increment | string $key, int $offset = 1 | int | Increments value in store by existing key and offset, then returns it. Throws [Lucinda\NoSQL\KeyNotFoundException](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/KeyNotFoundException.php) if key doesn't exist in store! |
| decrement | string $key, int $offset = 1 | int | Decrements value in store by existing key and offset, then returns it. Throws [Lucinda\NoSQL\KeyNotFoundException](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/KeyNotFoundException.php) if key doesn't exist in store! |
| delete | string $key | void | Deletes value from store by existing key. Throws [Lucinda\NoSQL\KeyNotFoundException](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/KeyNotFoundException.php) if key doesn't exist in store! |
| flush | void | void | Clears all values in store. |

If any of above operations fails due to server issues, a [Lucinda\NoSQL\OperationFailedException](https://github.com/aherne/php-nosql-data-access-api/blob/v4.0/src/OperationFailedException.php) is thrown!
